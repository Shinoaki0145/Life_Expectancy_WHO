    "- **Real-world context**: Although there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population."

    "        - Risk: This approach smooths the data artificially, which can mask real fluctuations (e.g., natural disasters, epidemics, wars that cause sudden reductions in life expectancy in a particular year will be smoothed out by the average).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Selection Bias: As mentioned, underdeveloped or conflict-affected countries (which are unlikely to report data) were removed from the dataset. This means that models trained on this data may perform less accurately when predicting for extremely poor or politically unstable countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Classification Reliability: The Status column (Developed vs Developing) is based on countries' self-declaration or older standards, which sometimes do not reflect current economic realities (e.g., transition economies).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Raw data quality issues: Although corrected, the original data from developing countries are often of lower precision (due to poor statistical systems) than those from developed countries, leading to discrepancies in reliability between rows in the table."
